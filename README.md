# character-count

"I have created a character count feature using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in Visual Studio Code. This project includes a text area where users can input text, and a real-time character counter that updates as they type. JavaScript dynamically tracks the number of characters entered and displays the count, while CSS is used to style the interface for a clean and user-friendly experience. This functionality is useful for text input fields with character limits, such as social media posts or form submissions."
